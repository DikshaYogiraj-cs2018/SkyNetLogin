# SkyNetLogin
<big>
This is a single web page application which allows users to create a username and password.<br>
This is a basic PHP code which enters the data from the registration page and enters into the database.<br>
If the username and password exist then you will get a message that the user with the particular name exists.<br>
The database will not save the passwords of users it will hash them and store them. <br>
Thus preventing any kind of malicious and unauthorised access to the user's details.<br>
